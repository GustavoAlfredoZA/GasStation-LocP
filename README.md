# Petrol and diesel stations
## Definition
In this project we seek to make an interface in which we intend to provide all people with one of the decisions that causes us conflict Do I put gasoline here? Where will it be cheaper? Do I reach the next gas station?
## Overall Objectives
The objective of this project is to help people make decisions about where to buy their gasoline, the place that is closest to them but at the same time convenient for them in terms of price, among other things. One of the examples that we try to reduce is when you want to go to a gas station that is cheaper but is very far away, so you will get the same, you should go to one that is closer but is a little more expensive, so with this project we try to decide this type of issues.
